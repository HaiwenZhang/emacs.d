C-h k: describes a key

* The Theory of Movement

** The Basics
C-x C-f: Find (Open) a file
C-x C-s: Save the buffer
C-x C-w: Write to a new file
C-x s: save all files
C-x b: Switch buffer
C-x C-b: List all buffers
C-x k: Kill a buffer
C-x C-b: Display all open buffers
C-x C-c: Exits Emacs
ESC ESC ESC: Exits out of prompts, regions, prefix arguments and returns to just one window
C-/: Undo Changes
C-x u: Undo Tree
F-10: Activates the menu bar
C-h C <RET> List coding system in use for the current buffer.


** Window Management

C-x 0: Deletes the active window
C-x 1: Deletes other windows
C-x 2: Split window below
C-x 3: Split window right
C-x o: Switch active window

C-x 4 C-f: Finds a file in the other window
C-x 4 d: Opens M-x dired in the other window
C-x 4 C-o: Displays a buffer in the other window
C-x 4 b: Switches the buffer in the other window and makes it the active window
C-x 4 0: Kills the buffer and window

** Frame Management

C-x 5 2: Create a new frame
C-x 5 b: Switch buffer in other frame
C-x 5 0: Delete active frame
C-x 5 1: Delete other frames
C-x 5 C-f: Finds a file in the other window
C-x 5 d: Opens M-x dired in the other window
C-x 5 C-o: Displays a buffer in ther other window

** Elemental Movement

C-f: Move forward by character
C-b: Move backward by character
C-p: Move to previous line
C-n: Move to next line
C-j: Create new line
C-a: Move point to the beginning of the line
C-e: Move point to the end of the line
M-m: Move pont to the first non-whitespace character on this line
M-f: Move forward by word
M-b: Move backward by word

*** Sub- and Superword Movement

M-x subword-mode: Minor mode that treats CamelCase as distinct words
M-x superword-mode: Minor mode that treats snake_case as one word

** Moving by S-Expressions

Balenced expressions include:
  Strings " or '
  Brackets [], (), {}, <>

C-M-f: Move forward by s-expression
C-M-b: Move backward by s-expression
C-M-d: Move down into a list
C-M-u: Move up out of a list
C-M-n: Move forward to the next list
C-M-p: Move backward to the previous list

** Other Movement Commands
M-}: Move forward to end of paragraph
M-{: Move backward to start of paragrah
M-a: Move to beginning of sentence
M-e: Move to end of sentence
C-M-a: Move to beginning of defun
C-M-e: Move to end of defun
C-x ]: Move forward one page
C-x [: Move backward one page

** Scrolling
C-v: Scroll down one page
M-v: Scroll up one page
C-M-v: Scroll down the other window
C-M-S-v: Scroll up the other window

C-x <: Scroll left
C-x >: Scroll right
 
M-<: Move to the beginning of the buffer
M->: Move to the end of the buffer
